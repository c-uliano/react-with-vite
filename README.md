# First React App With Vite
Just testing it out, documenting any differences between using Vite and using create-react-app.
- it's main.jsx, not index.js like in create-react-app
- styling specific to what's in App.jsx is still in App.css
- index.css has general styling set, with a media query for prefers-color-scheme to match your system's color scheme
